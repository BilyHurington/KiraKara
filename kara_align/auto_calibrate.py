"""Automatic LRC offset (detailed mode "自动匹配", simple mode "自动检测").

A plain-mode alignment on a throw-away copy of the project gives each line's
sung start, without looking at the LRC times.  Each timed line then votes for
an offset (sung start − LRC time).  The offset is the densest cluster of votes
(the most lines within ±0.3 s of each other), refined as the median of that
cluster, so lines the trial got wrong (a chorus sung twice, an ad-lib) cannot
move it.  No reference recording is needed.

The estimate is *confident* (``confident``: the simple mode then uses it
without asking) only when the evidence is clear:

- enough timed lines (``MIN_LINES``);
- most of them in the cluster (``MIN_TIGHT`` within ±``TIGHT_MS``);
- the cluster spans the song (lines from its first and its last quarter);
- no drift along the song (``MAX_DRIFT_MS``): a slope means another tempo or
  version, which one global offset cannot fix.

Otherwise ``reason`` says why, and the user marks the first onset as before
(with the estimate as the starting point).  Stems are only used while they
belong to the current original (``service.stems_current``); otherwise the
trial runs on the original and no vocal onset is given.  Nothing is saved.
